Welcome to TinDog, a dating app for...dogs...
This is a landing page that I created as part of a bootcamp. 

The entire page was made using HTML, CSS, and my new favorite..Bootstrap 5.

I encountered some issues while following along and doing this project, as the tutor was using an older version of Bootstrap, but using the documentation and my good frined (stackoverflow) I was able to work through these styling issues. 

I tried to work through each section on my own, before watching the tutor work through them. The finished product is not as perfect as hers, and the formatting may not be the most efficient,  but I'm glad I was able to show that I could do it on my own. 

I hope you like the landing page!
